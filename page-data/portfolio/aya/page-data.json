It contains a b2b mobile application and a web application designed specifically for customers.</p>\n<p>Aya was created in order to simplify the work of masters and beauty salons. The mobile application replaces a paper logbook or administrator responsibilities. The web service for customers allows everyone to choose a master based on photographs of the masterâ€™s work, reviews, price and location. And after choosing - book a time for the master directly on the site, bypassing calls and messengers.</p>\n<p>We worked on the SCRUM system. My responsibility in this project was a web application for clients. By the time it was decided to develop it a client service, the AYA-master application for mobile devices had already been developed and launched.</p>\n<p>Working in tandem with the designer, we developed interfaces for booking, timing, viewing the catalog. It was very important to create the simplest design and clear logic so that even the oldest generation could use the application. We held regular testing of interfaces to real customers and adjust to their needs</p>\n<p>My primary task was to develop the architecture for the application from scratch. In the future, it was expected that the application would grow rapidly, expand its functionality and increase the number of developers. It was important to make the application easily modifiable, easily extensible, and easily testable. For the front end, I wrote unit tests on jest / enzyme, for catching bugs in production I used an error tracker with a notification email. QA testing was carried out by the entire SCRUM team.</p>\n<p>Increasing the ranking in search results was not a priority, since other methods of attracting\ncustomers were used. However, SSR has been added to the pages of the catalog</p>\n<p>At the moment, the project continues to grow, gradually expanding the functionality and updated\ndatabase of masters.
